# Example: root modules structure

This example mirrors files from the modules directory into the current directory, making them part of the root module as opposed to including them as child modules.

For example, the `iam-dev` stack-environment is comprised of:

* `modules/stack/*`
* `modules/stack-iam/*`
* `iam/dev/pretf.py`
* `iam/dev/iam.dev.auto.tfvars`
